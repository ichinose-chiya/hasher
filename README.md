# Hasher

My psersonal implementation to some hash algorithm.

### Usage

> You need to have a compiler for C++ and have the CMAKE and MAKE installed.

You'd better comple this in an individual folder. Here's an example:

```shell
$ mkdir build
build$ cmake ..
build$ make
```

Then the `CMake` will do everything for you. Enjoy it with this command:

```shell
$ ./hasher {algorithm} {string_to_hash}
```
